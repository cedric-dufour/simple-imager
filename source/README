Simple Imager - Installation Material Source
********************************************

Overview
========

A Simple Imager source is any host that is to be used as reference to have its
image copied (pulled) by the Simple Imager server (the so-called 'golden client'
in SystemImager stanza).

As such, it does nothing else than make itself temporarily available to the
Simple Imager server to have its image pulled via RSync, thanks to the
'si_source' wrapper.
