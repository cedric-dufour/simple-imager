Simple Imager - Linux Imaging and Deployment Made Easy
******************************************************

Simple Imager is a set of tools allowing an imaging *server* to retrieve
a copy of Linux reference hosts (*sources*) and allowing those *images*
to be deployed to other *target* hosts by the mean of RSync or BitTorrent
files download.

Simple Imager is a heavily stripped-down, refactored, cleaned-up, Debian-
centric, consolidated and hopefully thoroughly documented version of its two
ancestor projects - namely SystemImager [1] and SALI [2] - motivated by their
apparent defunct status (as of April 2017).

Simple Imager consists of four different parts/sub-projects:
 - the 'source' part, aimed at the "source" host (aka. "golden client" in
   SystemImager stanza), allowing its "image" to be retrieved by the imaging
   "server" (see below) via RSync.
 - the 'server' part, aimed at the imaging "server", which "pulls" the
   images from the various source hosts into its repository, "packs" the
   content of those images into download-friendly tarballs and torrents,
   and eventually allow them to be retrieved by "target" hosts (see below),
   via RSync or BitTorrent.
 - the 'target' part, aimed at "target" hosts that are installed by
   network-booting into a dedicated light-weight (PXE-friendly) Linux
   environment, in order to retrieve their attributed image from the imaging
   server, along the configured/user-provided installation script.
 - the 'monitor' part, ideally co-hosted on the imaging server, which allows
   to keep track of ongoing target hosts installation and run ad-hoc hooks
   (scripts) for each significant step (start, progress, error, etc.).

Simple Imager aims at being as simple and light-weight as possible. Compared
to its SystemImager ancestor, it lacks the following features:
 - auto-retrieval of the Linux kernel (aka. UYOK in SystemImager stanza);
   experienced has shown that a dedicated kernel and carefully tuned
   Linux environment better serve the purpose at hand; this was addressed
   by the SystemImager's BOEL and SALI projects in their time, and now by
   the 'target' part/sub-project of Simple Imager.
 - auto-generation of installation scripts, dependent on installed
   System Configurator [3]; apart from the latter also being a defunct
   project, this task is highly specific to the user preferences and
   better left to her to deal with; sample installation scripts are
   provided to get one started.
 - XML-based configuration of target image and overrides; this is now
   achieved using a 'genders' [4] file, which can easily be queried with
   the ad-hoc tools (readily available as a Debian package).
 - server network (PXE/DHCP/TFTP/etc.) boot environment; such a setup is
   highly specific to the user environment and potentially already existing
   for other purposes; PXE boot - be it legacy PC(BIOS) or (U)EFI - along
   with the chosen DHCP/TFTP/etc. servers and bootloader(s) - SysLinux,
   GRUB, etc. - MUST be setup independently.
 - graphical installation (progress) monitoring; nice-to-have but not
   worth the trouble; installation progress will be stored by Simple Imager
   monitor into a SQLite database, which the user may query as he deems fit.

The final objective is to provide a MUCH simpler imaging/deployment framework,
delegating the most complex building blocks to existing projects, keeping
only the minimum codebase required to achieve its purpose, and hopefully
providing a product that is easier to maintain.
