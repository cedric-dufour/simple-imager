Simple Imager - Installation Monitoring Service
***********************************************

The Simple Imager monitor service allows target hosts to report their
installation progress and status.

It differs *entirely* from its SystemImager ancestor:

* While the SystemImager "legacy" protocol is still supported, a new
  RESTful API/daemon is now provided and preferred.

* Only installation progress and status are monitored; information about
  target hardware, kernel, etc. is entirely discarded.

* Installation progress and status data are stored into a SQLite3 database:
  see the /var/lib/system-imager/si_monitor.sqlite file.
  This database can be readily queried with ad-hoc (external) utilities;
  NO such utilities are provided by Simple Imager itself.

* Additional processing is dedicated to user-provided hooks (scripts):
  see /etc/simple-imager/si_monitor.hooks.d/SAMPLE for an example;
  NO "internal" processing is achieved by Simple Imager itself.
