Simple Imager - Target Installation Environment
***********************************************

The Simple Imager target installation environment is a light-weight Linux
environment, using only upstream sources to build its dedicated Linux kernel
and the initrd image containing all the utilities required to carry out the
installation of a target host:
 - starting by initializing the hardware (udev)
 - configuring the network (Busybox udhcpc)
 - partitioning and formatting the disks (parted, e2fsprogs, LVM, etc.)
 - downloading the target image and overrides (rsync, aria2c)
 - unpacking the image and overrides efficiently (pixzi, pbzip2, pigz)
 - reporting the installation progress to the Simple Imager monitor (curl)
 - etc.

Once built (see the BUILD file), the resulting 'kernel' and 'initrd.img' files
are to be installed in the user existing network (PXE) boot environment (also
see sample 'grub.cfg' and 'pxelinux.cfg' files).

The target installation scripts (see the README.scripts file) ought to be
installed in the Simple Imager server, to be retrieved via RSync as part of the
target installation initialization (thus allowing them to be easily modified,
without having the rebuild the installation environment itself).

Users are expected to customize those scripts to match their installation and
configuration requirements (see the README.enviroment and README.variables
files).

By using the BitTorrent protocol to download installation images - which can
weight up to several gigabytes (even when using XZ compression) - and main-
taining the targets as "seeders" as long as possible (until their installation
is complete), simultaneous large-scale deployment (several hundreds hosts) can
be performed, without taxing the central storage infrastructure, and in a
matter of minutes (thanks also to multi-threaded decompression of downloaded
tarballs).
