This directory contains the Linux kernel configure for each target architecture.

In the context of Simple Imager, the objective of this configuration is
two-fold:
- make the kernel (and initrd-stored modules) as small as possible,
  for fast network (PXE) boot
- while still providing required hardware support

It comes down two:
- disabling all unrequired hardware, protocols, subsystems and benchmarking/
  test/debug options
- enable just the hardware, protocols and subsytems required for the Simple
  Imager target to achieve its purpose: boot, initialize the network, retrieve
  and finally install the system image (and that's it!)
