Simple Imager - Linux Imaging and Deployment Made Easy
******************************************************

Global Concept
==============

The objective of Simple Imager is to provide a framework to easily maintain
host images and automatically deploy them to other hosts, potentially up
to several hundreds simultaneously.

In order to do so, Simple Imager provides or relies on the following
components:

* "Source" hosts - also known as "Golden Clients" - which are manually
  installed and carefully tuned to match one's requirements. When ready,
  they will make themselves available to the imaging server (see below)
  via a RSync service *temporarily* enabled for that purpose.

* An imaging "Server", from which the source hosts "Image" - a copy of
  their entire (local) disk(s) - will be "Pulled" via RSync into a
  central repository. Each image will then be "Packed" into its corres-
  ponding "tarball" and "torrent" file, ready to be deployed, via RSync
  or BitTorrent, to target hosts (see below).

* "Target" hosts, which be (re-)installed by booting into a dedicated light-
  weight (PXE-friendly) Linux installation environment via the network,
  where a user-provided installation "Script(s)" will be executed to:
   - partition the disk(s)
   - format the partition(s)
   - download the image from the imaging server (via RSync or BT)
   - install (unpack) the image
   - configure host-specific components (mostly hostname and network)
   - re-configure (re-install) the bootloader on the disk(s)
   - reboot the host into its new image

* A "Monitor" server, ideally co-hosted along the imaging server, which
  allow target hosts to report their installation progress and status,
  and take appropriate steps when needed; e.g. reconfigure the network
  bootloader to have the target host boot from its local disk when the
  installation is complete.

* An *external* DNS server, with A and PTR records for all target hosts.

* An *external* DHCP server, configured to allow all target hosts to
  boot via the network (PXE boot) with an IP address matching that of
  the DNS server.

* An *external* TFTP server, hosting the bootloader(s) - SysLinux, GRUB,
  etc. - matching that of the DHCP server and its PXE configuration.

* An *external* (optional) HTTP server, ideally co-hosted with the TFTP
  server, allowing the bootloader to retrieve the target installation
  environment's "Kernel" and "InitRD" via faster/more-reliable TCP (HTTP)
  networking rather than UDP (TFTP).

Simple Imager makes no - and will never! - attempt to provide the last
four of these components since:
1. they are most likely already existing in the user environment;
2. their installation and configuretion being purposes of their own,
   (way) out of the scope of Simple Image purpose (and objective to
   remain as simple as possible).


Step-by-Step
============

On the "Source" host
--------------------

Start by installing and configure the source host such as to fit your
requirements.

Then install the (very light-weight) 'simple-imager-source' package.

Execute the 'si_source' script to make the "source" host temporarily available
for the Simple Imager server to copy (pull) its image.


On the Simple Imager "Server"
-----------------------------

Install and configure the 'simple-imager-server' package (along the optional
but highly-recommended 'simple-imager-target-scripts' package).

Make the source host(s) available to have their image copied (pull); see above.

Execute the 'si_pull' script to pull the image(s) from the source host(s).

Execute the 'si_pack' script to pack the image(s) into download/torrent-friendly
tarballs.

Configure target host(s) installation by editing the '/etc/genders' file.

Copy, adapt or write your own installation scripts to match your requirements
(see the 'simple-imager-target-scripts' package documentation for further
details).

Launch the Simple Image server:
 - as a service: 'service si_server start'
 - manually:     'si_server start'


On the Simple Imager "Monitor"
------------------------------
(ideally co-hosted on the Simple Imager server)

Install and configure the 'simple-imager-monitor' package.

Use 'sqlite3' tool to query the '/var/lib/simple-imager/si_monitor.sqlite'
database and monitor target host(s) installation progress.

Write your own monitoring hooks into '/etc/simple-imager/si_monitor.hooks.d'.


On the "Target" host
--------------------

Install the 'simple-imager-target-boot' package and copy the provided kernel
and initrd in your existing PXE/TFTP server.

Make sure you have installation material and configuration ready on the Simple
Imager server; see above.

Make sure the target has entries in your DNS and DHCP servers:
 - DNS:  A and PTR records
 - DHCP: network (PXE) boot into Simple Imager target installation environment

Boot the target host into Simple Imager target installation environment, which
will automatically carry out the host installation.
