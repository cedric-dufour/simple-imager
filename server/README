Simple Imager - Installation Material Server
********************************************

Overview
========

The Simple Imager server gathers and makes target installation material -
images, overrides, scripts and installation configuration - available for
download by target installation hosts.

It is thus intended to perform three tasks:
 - pull (copy) reference images from source hosts using RSync (si_pull)
 - pack those images into download/torrent-friendly tarballs (si_pack)
 - make those images, along other installation material, available for download
   by target installation hosts, via RSync or BitTorrent (si_server)

Overrides complement images by allowing to complement target installation
with purpose-specific material (be it configuration files, additional binaries,
etc.)

Please refer to Simple Imager target package/documentation for further
information on installation scripts (README.scripts).

Simple Imager installation configuration is managed through a 'genders' [1],
thanks to the following ad-hoc attributes:
 - 'si_target'     designates the entry as a Simple Imager target
 - 'si_group'      specifies the installation group
 - 'si_image'      specifies the installation image
 - 'si_overrides'  specifies a (colon-separated) list of installation overrides
 - 'si_script'     specify the (actual) installation script

Other attributes are available to further-configure the installation; please
refer to Simple Imager target package/documentation for further information on
environment variables (README.variables).
